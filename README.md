Name of Project: Pin-Brawl!

Project's Purpose or Goal: 2 player local pinball game. The gameboard is two pinball screens side by side with a way for the ball to travel between each players screen. if the opposing players ball gets through the other players screen a point is scored.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

3d model incorporating two pinball tables with a bridge at the top for the ball to travel between the two boards.
Points will be scored when a player successfully hits the ball over to the opponent's table and the ball passes through the opposing player's drain 
Each player starts with their own ball.  They will have 3 balls each initially
Win state will either be the first player to 5 points or possibly keeping score as a normal pinball game would and comparing the scores after balls have run out.  Sinking the ball down your opponent's drain would earn bonus points.
  supports 2 players  
What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

c#
Unity
image editing software
If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

main add on would be power ups that help you defeat your opponent - lots of possibilities here from multiball to changing gravity etc .
online capability
What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

not sure at the moment - possibly advanced physics engine?
for online capability- I will have to research that
